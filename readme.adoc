[abstract]
Simple little applications for your G13 keyboard. Very useful for https://github.com/ecraven/g13[g13] users.

IMPORTANT: Work In Progress -- Applications are slowly developed step by step.

toc::[]

== How does it work?

The G13 mini-applications will use the keys already used for this purpose in Windows :

- Thus the L1-4 keys will be used to interact with the launched application. 
- The BD button will be used to return to the menu.

[NOTE]
--
However we will not change the configuration of the https://github.com/ecraven/g13[G13 driver] automatically. The configuration will have to be changed manually with the one supplied. 

See the keybind link:g13-apps.bind[].
--

Applications will be similar to the original G13. You will find a list of applications implemented or to be implemented.

== What applications?

- [x] Menu -- the application selector
- [x] Clock -- analog and digital
- [x] Music Player -- based upon MPRIS data

[NOTE]
--
All applications can be disabled at compile time. +
*Now works with enum_dispatch v0.3.2!*
--

NOTE: Feel free to open an issue (or PR) to request another application.

== Getting started

=== Prerequisites
First of all, you will need a recent Rust setup. See https://rustup.rs[Rustup] installation guide, if needed.

Before compiling g13-apps, you will need to know the paths to the in and out pipes of the https://github.com/ecraven/g13[G13 driver].
By default, it's `/tmp/g13-0` (in) and `/tmp/g13-0_out` (out).

.Set-up the env-var:
```shell
$ set -x G13_IN /run/g13d/g13-0
$ set -x G13_OUT /run/g13d/g13-0_out
```

[WARNING]
Please note that the indicated pipe paths are included and compiled. + 
If the paths ever change, it will be necessary to recompile the whole app.

Also, you have to kown what applications you want and select the features you want.
Keep them in mind, we will need that soon.

=== Build and Install

Now you have two ways in front of you:
`cargo install` or clone, build and copy.

==== Cargo install

With cargo install, all you have to do is :
```shell
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/fusetim/g13-apps [--features <feature1> [feature2..] ]
```

This command will build G13 Apps with the given features and install it at `$HOME/.cargo/bin/g13-apps` (by default, look for --root for custom path).

==== Clone, Build and Copy

To build g13-apps, you need to clone the repo:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/fusetim/g13-apps.git
```

And finally, you can build the apps with all the features you want:
```shell
$ cargo build --release [--features <feature1> [feature2..] ]
```

And now, enjoy your new application at `./target/release/g13-apps`.

If you want to use g13-apps as a system app or a user service, you should now copy the binary in a PATH-known directory or add it to your path.
For the user service, any directory can work.

=== Install as a user service

NOTE: These steps focus on the *systemd User Service*. Feel free to do a PR to add another system.

Now you surely want to use tis app as a user system and not launch it by yourself.
So, check out the link:g13-apps.service[] and install it in `$HOME/.config/systemd/user/`.

You should now enable it with:
```shell
$ systemctl --user enable g13-apps
```

and you can start it:

```shell
$ systemctl --user start g13-apps
```

Now, g13-apps will be launch when you boot :)

=== Keybinds

All you have to do now is configure the right key-binding (in the G13 driver's config) and you will be able to take advantage of all the applications you have chosen. See link:g13-apps.bind[] for example.

By default, the G13 keybinds is at `/etc/g13d/default.bind`. 

And finally, you can now use all the powers of this g13 apps.
