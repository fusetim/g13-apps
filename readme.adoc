[abstract]
Simple little applications for your G13 keyboard. Very useful for https://github.com/ecraven/g13[g13] users.

IMPORTANT: Work In Progress -- The software is far from being usable.

== How does it work?

The G13 mini-applications will use the keys already used for this purpose in Windows :

- Thus the L1-4 keys will be used to interact with the launched application. 
- The BD button will be used to return to the menu.

NOTE: However we will not change the configuration of the https://github.com/ecraven/g13[G13 driver] automatically. The configuration will have to be changed manually with the one supplied.

Applications will be similar to the original G13. You will find a list of applications implemented or to be implemented.

== What applications?

- [X] Menu -- the application selector
- [ ] Music Player -- based upon MPRIS data
- [X] Clock -- analog and digital

WARNING: Applications can be disabled at compile time (thanks to features flag). However this is not yet the case.

NOTE: Feel free to open an issue (or PR) to request another application.
